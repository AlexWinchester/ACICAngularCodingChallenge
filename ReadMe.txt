Specification's

Comments from business unit: "Recently I was updating the types of business one our agents was allowed to quote when I realized that I didn't know
how often each type of insurance coverage was quoted.  This information could be learned through reports, but it would be very convenient to be able
to identify which types of insurance were most popular and which ones were not being quoted often when updating an agents authority.  Could we get 
something added to the screen?"

Comments from technical specifications team: "The UX team has reviewed the functionality request and believes it would be most useful for users if
their requested data appeared on all screens, directly below the existing tabs "Search" and "View All Lines Of Business".  The existing quote data
is available in "in-memory-data.service.ts", but will need to be summed and displayed for it to be useful.  Knowing the two most popular lines of 
business all the time would be best.  In addition, displaying how many quotes a given line of business has on the details page would be useful for 
the user."
